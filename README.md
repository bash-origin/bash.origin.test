**INTENDED USE:** The *Logic and Code contained within* forms a **Developer Tool** and is intended to operate as part of a *Web Software Development Toolchain* on which a *Production System* operates indirectly. It is **NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN HIGH-LOAD ENVIRONMENTS** as there is *little focus on Runtime Optimization* in order to *maximize API Utility, Compatibility and Flexibility*. The logic & code **HAS NOT BEEN VALIDATED BY A SECURITY AUDIT** and is **NOT GUARANTEED** TO KEEP
PRIVATE INFORMATION NOR YOUR IDENTITY SECURE!

If you *need more* than what is contained within, study the Code, understand the Logic, and build your *Own Implementation* that is *API Compatible*. Share it with others who follow the same *Logic* and *API Contract* specified within. This Community of Users will likely want to use Your Work in their own *Software Development Toolchains*.
